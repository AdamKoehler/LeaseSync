# LeaseSync Property Management App (In Progress)

## Project Overview

The goal of this app is to provide a streamlined platform for renters and landlords to manage their lease agreements, property listings, maintenance requests, and financial transactions.

This is a full-stack CRM application designed to help me gain hands-on experience with Angular, C#, and Azure

## Features

- Users create an account and choose a role (renter or landlord)

- View and manage rental listings (leases)

- Track and submit maintenance requests

- Log and view payment history

## Technologies Used

- Angular 19.2.14
- .NET 8
- Entity Framework
- Azure (for hosting and database)

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
